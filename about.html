    <h1>Welcome to Justice League Sidekick Recruitment Program</h1>
    <p>This initiative was created by the students of Victoria University in Group 16.
    <p></p>Our mission is simple: give everyone and anyone a chance to serve by a great hero's side!</p>
    <p>This project was made possible by the incredible creativity, dedication, and skills of our team members. We
      extend our heartfelt gratitude to <b>Kristen Saad</b>, our group leader, and <b>Fresh Teacher</b>, the head of
      construction, for their outstanding leadership and guidance throughout the project.</p>
    <p>Special thanks to <b>Moi⁩</b> and the rest of the team for providing the captivating images that brought our
      vision to life. Each member contributed their unique talents, time, and effort, making this initiative a reality.
    </p>
    <p>Together, we've built a platform that not only inspires but also empowers individuals to embrace their inner
      hero. We couldn't have done it without the passion and commitment of every team member.</p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to inspire and empower individuals to embrace their unique abilities and use them for the greater
